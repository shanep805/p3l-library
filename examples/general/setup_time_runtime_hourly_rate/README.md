# Setup Time, Runtime, Hourly Rate
This is an all purpose operation template that enables pricing based on a one time fixed setup time, and a per quantity runtime.
The established setup time will happen once regardless of quantity.
The runtime will be applied per quantity.
Total cost is calculated by multiplying a defined hourly rate with setup time plus that same hourly rate times the runtime times the quantity.
We will update the workpiece with the contributions of setup time and runtime to the running total across all operations.
